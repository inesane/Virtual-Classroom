# Virtual-Classroom

This application implements a virtual classroom which can run on Android mobile devices as well as VR headsets. The app was built using Unity 3D Game Engine and Google VR Cardboard SDK. An external device can be used in order to interact with the whiteboard and PPT using a react app.
 
Other than rendering the basic classroom and allowing participants to join the classroom and interact with the environment, some specifics include: 
- Voice chat
- Real time interaction with peers
- Ability to share presentations
- Whiteboard with functionalities such as drawing and writing
- Different types of users (students and teachers) with administrative rights for teachers such as mute
